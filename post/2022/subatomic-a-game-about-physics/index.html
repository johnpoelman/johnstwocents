      <p>A cool thing about playing boardgames is that from time to time you can really learn something. In <strong>Subatomic</strong> you can learn a lot about cool physics and chemistry!</p>
<p>This game is a game that I backed on Kickstarter a couple of years ago and has been played a couple of times with my kids back in the day. The coolest thing about this is  that I have a numbered edition, I have 224 out of 3400! Now that my kids grow a bit older they aren&rsquo;t in playing boardgames anymore so this game was sitting in the closet for a while, untill now.</p>
<p>Recently I played this with friends and I realised how cool this game was. It&rsquo;s coming more to the table again for sure, I&rsquo;m really glad I visited the booth from <strong>Genius Games</strong> at <a href="https://www.spiel-messe.com/en/">Spiel &lsquo;22</a>! That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve got the inspiration for playing this again.</p>

<h2 id="the-story">The story</h2>
<p><strong>In Subatomic players try to build chemical elements</strong>. They start with a couple of up quarks and down quarks, by combining these you can create protons, neutrons or electrons. They can also use their quarks to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; cards that hold protons, neutrons or electrons to make their deck stronger.</p>
<p>During the game players can hire famous scientists that give them, let&rsquo;s call it special powers. These &ldquo;powers&rdquo; allow them to do special things that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without these special friends.</p>
<p>Turns keep going by until a player builds his last element, then the round gets finished and the game is over!</p>

<h2 id="my-two-cents">My two cents</h2>
<p>One piece of criticism about this game for me, and this is personal taste, is the artwork. Artwork is for me one of the most important things in a game, it forms the first impression. The artwork is not that pretty. The box looks good but the layout of the playerboards aren&rsquo;t my cup of tea along with the mainboard. I have to admit that the artwork is thematically correct and perhaps created that way by purpose. Though some things could be more intuitive, some symbols could be more clear but I&rsquo;m not here to roast the game.</p>
<p>I really do like the game, what it lacks in design it makes up for with realism, the possibility to use this game in a classroom and the different tactics to explore and win the game. It&rsquo;s a cool game to play with your kids to make them interested in science, perhaps they want to read the booklet with the scientific information about the game that is included afterwards!</p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m happy that this game is part of my collection and it will never leave it. You are asking for a score? It rate it a <strong>4 out of 5</strong>.</p>
