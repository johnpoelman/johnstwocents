      <description>A cool thing about playing boardgames is that from time to time you can really learn something. In Subatomic you can learn a lot about cool physics and chemistry!
This game is a game that I backed on Kickstarter a couple of years ago and has been played a couple of times with my kids back in the day. The coolest thing about this is that I have a numbered edition, I have 224 out of 3400!</description>
