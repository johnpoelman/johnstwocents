      <description>This issue crossed my path after installing VMWare ESXi on a brand new server. After logging for the first time I got a little notice that said: TPM device detected but a connection could not be established.
With security in min this is something that you can&amp;rsquo;t leave like this so I started a little search and I ended up with the following solution. Bare in mind, the following solution is only tested with Dell servers as I haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced this with other brands that I use, like Lenovo.</description>

      <description>While the pandemic was ongoing we all switched from working at the office to working at home, todays evolution is more leaning to the hybrid working model. While I like going to the office again everyday a lot of colleagues still work more at home and that means: &amp;ldquo;Teams meetings&amp;rdquo;. While at work we use the Jabra headset the comfort isn&amp;rsquo;t all that well, because of that I got myself this more luxurious and comfortable headset.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to another blog about artificial intelligence. In case you are a new reader you should definately read the previous blog too about chatGPT, the AI chatbot! You can read it here.
 Where chatGPT is a chatbot, Dall-E is a digital artisan.
 By giving it a description of which image you want, Dall-E generates a couple of images for you and I must admit that the results are pretty whopping.</description>

      <description>Technology is something that is constantly evolving. When you take a look at Gartner&amp;rsquo;s hypecycle you can see a curve that shows you which technologies are coming our way. You will see a couple of different topics regarding AI, and that&amp;rsquo;s where todays post is talking about.
A big name in this artificial intelligence space is OpenAI thanks to it&amp;rsquo;s 2 big projects that you can recognize by the names of:</description>

      <title>My 3D Printing Setup and settings</title>

      <description>Often questions are asked about how I do my 3D prints. 3D Printing is a hobby that&amp;rsquo;s getting picked up by a broader audience at this point. The main reason for this according to my humble self is the current pricepoint to start with. You can have a decent 3D printer for about 200 euro, this can give you already some decent results and it gets even better when you perform some basic upgrades.</description>

      <description>A cool thing about playing boardgames is that from time to time you can really learn something. In Subatomic you can learn a lot about cool physics and chemistry!
This game is a game that I backed on Kickstarter a couple of years ago and has been played a couple of times with my kids back in the day. The coolest thing about this is that I have a numbered edition, I have 224 out of 3400!</description>

      <description>Lately, I have been doing some changes on my home network that involved vlanning. Of course, when you say vlan &amp;amp; Sonos in one sentence you&amp;rsquo;ve got to make ready for some issues. You can find my lessons learned in this blog. I can tell you that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy to overcome this.
Situation My network looks a little bit like this:
 Vlan: Internet of things Vlan: End user devices Lan with all the Unifi devices  I&amp;rsquo;m using a Unifi Cloudkey Gen2 plus as my Unifi controller.</description>

      <description>Yes, it is possible. You can run a website for virtually no money thanks to a couple of software and services. Actually, you don&amp;rsquo;t need a full fledged CMS for a personal website.
 A CMS is the abbreviation of a content management system and is a website that&amp;rsquo;s built around a database and forms to add content to the website. This means a lot of code that can be abused by not so friendly visitors.</description>

      <description>Hi,
After some years of absence in the blog-o-sphere, I decided to start writing again. After running a successfull blog for quite some time I was ready to take some time off as running the blog was too time-consuming.
I had the joy back then to organize Blogosphere, a meetup for Belgian bloggers, work with PR agencies and attend different press events. I guess I did all what I wanted to achieve back in the day.</description>
