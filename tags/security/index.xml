      <description>This issue crossed my path after installing VMWare ESXi on a brand new server. After logging for the first time I got a little notice that said: TPM device detected but a connection could not be established.
With security in min this is something that you can&amp;rsquo;t leave like this so I started a little search and I ended up with the following solution. Bare in mind, the following solution is only tested with Dell servers as I haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced this with other brands that I use, like Lenovo.</description>
