      <description>Often questions are asked about how I do my 3D prints. 3D Printing is a hobby that&amp;rsquo;s getting picked up by a broader audience at this point. The main reason for this according to my humble self is the current pricepoint to start with. You can have a decent 3D printer for about 200 euro, this can give you already some decent results and it gets even better when you perform some basic upgrades.</description>
