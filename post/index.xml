      <description>Hi,
After some years of absence in the blog-o-sphere, I decided to start writing again. After running a successfull blog for quite some time I was ready to take some time off as running the blog was too time-consuming.
I had the joy back then to organize Blogosphere, a meetup for Belgian bloggers, work with PR agencies and attend different press events. I guess I did all what I wanted to achieve back in the day.</description>
