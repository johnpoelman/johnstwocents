      <description>Yes, it is possible. You can run a website for virtually no money thanks to a couple of software and services. Actually, you don&amp;rsquo;t need a full fledged CMS for a personal website.
 A CMS is the abbreviation of a content management system and is a website that&amp;rsquo;s built around a database and forms to add content to the website. This means a lot of code that can be abused by not so friendly visitors.</description>

      <description>Hi,
After some years of absence in the blog-o-sphere, I decided to start writing again. After running a successfull blog for quite some time I was ready to take some time off as running the blog was too time-consuming.
I had the joy back then to organize Blogosphere, a meetup for Belgian bloggers, work with PR agencies and attend different press events. I guess I did all what I wanted to achieve back in the day.</description>
